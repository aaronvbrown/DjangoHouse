# DjangoHouse
Django WebApp for the Home, to include aids for remote learning and family life.

The project's initial app is the polls app from the tutorial found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/ 

The first new app is the schedule app to remind students when classes are supposed to start throughout the day. 

Development Environment
I'm using pipenv for my dev environment.  With pipenv installed on your system, you can replicate the virtual environment with the commands:  
# pipenv shell
# pipenv install
